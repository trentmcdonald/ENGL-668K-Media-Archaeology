There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot? 
The slowness across all of them is quite the difference. Also the aesthetic appeal of the objects themselves—the sickly yellow tint of age and boxy shapes and the unfortunately curved screens. I remember having pre-flat screen TVs and computers, but they look hideous now. As a point of reference think about how all Apple commercials make Apple nerds cool while PC nerds are represented by the paid-to-be-uncool John Hodgman.
My computer does not automatically boot to a game like the Vectrex. One’s mind immediately immerses when old arcade-like machines are booted up to days of greasy joysticks, hypnotic 8-bit soundtrack loops, and jingling quarters.

KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 1984
•	What operating system does it run? CP/M 2.2
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? $3400 (in ’84 dollars) / $7786 (adj. for inflation) / $160-300 (today’s dollars)*  How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). 
*For inflation calculations I used usinflationcalculator.com, for contemporary pricing eBay.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
    Strengths: The “J” and “F” keys were slightly different than the rest of the keys in order to assist in typing from memory. The Kaypro 4 has an onboard modem and two floppy disc drives. Flaws: It lacked sound, and it is horribly unattractive. Fun trivia: Arthur C. Clarke used one to write 2010: Odyssey Two.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

===================================================================================================================
APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 1983
•	What operating system does it run? DOS 3.3 or ProDos 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? $1995 (in ’83 dollars) / $4776 (adj. for inflation) / $100-300 (today’s dollars) How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). Easy.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
    The tutorial remains an engaging and informative experience—Apple is historically user friendly. The Apple IIe also included lower and upper case letters. Weakness: The massive price tag. The Apple IIe was manufactured for eleven years—a stunning amount of time considering our rapidly changing digital market.
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

====================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 1987
•	What operating system does it run? Mac OS 4.0
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)?  $2900 (in ’87 dollars) / $ 6074 (adj. for inflation) / $25-400 (today’s dollars) How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). Easy
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
    Some strengths an internal, onboard storage drive and a fan to help with cooling and therefore longevity. A weakness is the massive price, and the speed for which it was famous was inflated by Apple.
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
Trash and We Descend (another hypertext), a punnily titled folder named "Miss Sing"--the ability to access metadata, puzzle, calculator, note pad, scrapbook

===================================================================================================================
VECTREX

•	What year was it made? 1982
•	What operating system does it run? After much searching, I believe the OS was on one of its 8 in. floppy disks, and is simply known as Vectrex OS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? $199 (in ’82 dollars) / $490 (adj. for inflation) / $200-600 (today’s dollars, dependent on games in lot) How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). Easy.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? The     Vectrex had two controllers, allowing for siblings to play and then throw them when one defeats the other. It was seen as a failure, commercially, because it was released before the video game crash of 1983. It was a fairly cheap and early way to get a video game system in one’s house.
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Play MineStorm. Try another cartridge. Why do you think the designer’s would have opted for the “vector” graphics?
Vector graphics allow for easy scaling, and when the size is increased, the image quality is not degraded. When designing games for smaller screens like the Vectrex, the file size is none too large.

===================================================================================================================
AMIGA
•	What year was it made? 1985
•	What operating system does it run? AmigaDOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? $699 (in ’85 dollars ) / $1464 (adj. for inflation) / $400-800 (today’s dollars) How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). Medium difficulty
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
    The Amiga was relatively cheap compared to other home computers. Its sound and graphics caused the Amiga to become primarily known as a video gaming computer in addition to its word processing. Another strength was the error self-diagnosing via colors (e.g. green meaning that the RAM is not found or could be damaged). Weaknesses: Having to put those various disks in every startup, the eyesore that is the horrible blue background

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Try the demos. What else can it do? (Hint: try the “Amiga Appetizer” disk). Have a look at the Amiga magazines and the book, The Future Was Here.



===================================================================================================================
MACINTOSH IIci

•	What year was it made? 1989
•	What operating system does it run? System 7.5-Mac OS 7.6.1
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? $6269 (in ’89 dollars) / $12,030 (adj. for inflation) / $40-300 (today’s dollars) How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). Easy.
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
    This computer was one of the fastest computers at its time and had great storage capabilities and logevity.  Weakness: Why does this computer not use the universal symbol for power on/off? This was also the most expensive computer out of the ones surveyed.
  It was also the Macintosh standard bearer.
Turn it on (you must figure out how). Open WordPerfect. Open MS Word. Try typing a simple document in each. Which do you like better, and why? Open MacPaint. Try drawing something. (You don’t need to save any of your work from these applications.) 
MS Word is superior because it lays out your font and font size right in front of you, and the buttons for graphs and the now ubiquitous bold/italicize/underline buttons are already appearing in their rightful places.
What else is on this Mac? What can you learn about its past user(s)?
Among the files are: a catalogue of titles in a Diversity Video Series for February Black History month 1995; another list of videos for National Library Week 1995 including some readings of Poe’s stories and an interview with Allen Ginsberg. The computer has many documents relating to Hornbake Library. The man who probably collected these was named Allan. A poem (?) titled JUANA’S WORK SIGN the entirety of which reads:
JUANA’S INCOMING WORK
BOB’S INCOMING WORK
JUANA’S FINISHED WORK
BOB’S FINISHED WORK
in gigantic font.
